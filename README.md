# URL Classification into Productive or Non-Productive

## Overview
This project aims to classify URLs into two categories: productive and non-productive based on their web content. We'll use Python for the implementation.

## Introduction
Briefly describe the problem and the motivation behind this project. Explain why URL classification is important.

## Dataset
For this project, a self-created dataset is used, but you can procure any from Kaggle itself, just remember to replace the labels in the code accordingly.  
Sample dataset used:

## Data Preprocessing
Describe how you cleaned and prepared the data. Include steps like removing duplicates, handling missing values, and tokenization.

## Feature Extraction
Discuss the features you extracted from the URLs. Examples include domain names, path components, and query parameters.

## Model Building
Explain the machine learning model(s) you used for classification. Provide code snippets and discuss hyperparameter tuning.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.). Include visualizations if possible.

## Conclusion
Summarize the project, highlight key findings, and suggest future improvements.
