Original File:             POC_1_URL_Classification.ipynb

Lacked: 1. User-defined keywords to influence classification.
        2. Website content language barrier, i.e, for languages other than English.

Modified File (1):         POC_1_URL_Classification_mod.ipynb

Added:  1. User-defined productive and non-productive keywords to influence classification.
        2. Langdetect Googletrans Translator to override website content language barrier, i.e, for languages other than English.
Lacked: 1. Simplicity due to being a Notebook file.
        2. User input interface.

Modified File (2):         POC_1_URL_Classification_menu-driven.ipynb

Added:  1. Self-created functions, which allowed me to break down my code into smaller, manageable pieces, promoting code organization, reusability, and modularity.
        2. Menu-driven for simplicity and user-friendly code.
Lacked: 1. Sufficient data in dataset.
        2. User input interface.

Modified File (3):         POC_1_URL_Classification_menu-driven_Add_Data.ipynb

Added:  1. Self-created functions to push the resulting output into the original dataset to counter lack of data problem.
        2. Choice to push data into dataset, so as to prevent wrong results into the dataset, which will hamper further classifications.
        3. Newly updated dataset is then used to train the model for better results.
Lacked: 1. Discards the wrong resulting output (user judges the response/result to be right or wrong :: Initially).
        2. Small dataset problem prevails if wrong results are discarded, so thinking of inserting the opposite classification in case of wrong output.

Modified File (4):         POC_1_URL_Classification_menu-driven_AddCorrectData.ipynb

Added:  1. Choice to push correct data into dataset (judged by user), so as to prevent wrong results into the dataset, which will hamper further classifications.
Lacked: 1. Time consuming to add corrected data into dataset to enlargen it.
